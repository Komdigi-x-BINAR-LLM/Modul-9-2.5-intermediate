Amani’s profile exploded further in 2004 when Spanish giants Real Castellón acquired him for a record-breaking fee. Surrounded by an ensemble of high-profile attackers and midfielders, he played with unprecedented creative freedom. His most iconic moment came in the 2005 Continental Champions Cup final, where he scored a mesmerizing volley from the edge of the box — a strike that became one of the defining goals of the era. Over six seasons, Amani won multiple league titles, domestic cups, and international honors with Castellón, cementing his status as one of the decade’s definitive midfielders and a global sporting icon.
