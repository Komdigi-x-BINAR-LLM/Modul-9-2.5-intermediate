The 2006 WorldCup was turbulent for both Amani and Lorianne. Despite entering the tournament as favorites, they were eliminated early, and Amani struggled with a lingering ankle injury. Following this disappointment, he initially retired from international football, only to return in 2009 to lead a younger squad into the 2010 WorldCup. His final match became infamous after a confrontation with an opposing defender escalated into a heated altercation that earned him a red card. Despite the controversy, he finished the tournament as one of its standout performers and received the Bronze Globe award for best overall player.
