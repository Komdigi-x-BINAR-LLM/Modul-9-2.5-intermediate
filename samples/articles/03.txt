In 1995, he transferred to Rouverac FC, one of the country’s stronger clubs, where he spent four influential years. He helped guide Rouverac to deep domestic cup runs, earned a reputation as one of the league’s brightest creative talents, and drew international attention through strong performances in the Continental Cup of Clubs.
