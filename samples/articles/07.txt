The 2002 WorldCup Continental was Amani’s arrival on the world stage. His leadership and creativity guided Lorianne to their first-ever WorldCup final appearance, and he scored two crucial goals in the tournament. Although Lorianne ultimately lost the final, Amani became a national hero. Two years later, he delivered arguably the best football of his career during EuroTerran 2004, where his playmaking and clutch performances propelled Lorianne to the championship title. He was named Player of the Tournament, widely regarded at the time as the finest midfielder in the world.
