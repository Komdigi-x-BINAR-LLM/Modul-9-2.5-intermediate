In 1999, Amani signed with Fioranza Calcio in Italy’s Serie A, entering one of Europe’s most tactically rigorous leagues. He initially struggled with the defensive structure and physical intensity but gradually adapted, growing into a central orchestrator within Fioranza’s possession-heavy system. During his five-year stay, Amani helped the club secure two domestic titles and reach a Champions League final. It was in Italy that he reached global prominence, recognized for his ability to break down even the most disciplined defensive lines with patience, intelligence, and pinpoint passing.
