Amani developed a distinctive playing style built on fluid control, deliberate pacing, and masterful manipulation of space. Operating primarily as an advanced midfielder, he had an uncanny ability to retain the ball under pressure, using subtle shifts of balance and precise touches to escape crowded situations. Though not particularly fast or physically dominant, his timing, composure, and vision allowed him to dictate entire matches. Teammates often described playing with him as “having a compass on the pitch,” because he oriented attacks and calibrated tempo with near-mechanical consistency. His signature move — a sweeping pivot that seemed to freeze defenders — became emblematic of his technical grace.
